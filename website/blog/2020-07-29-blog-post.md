If you want to redo all your previous doodles with the new doodler, put all your images in data/images and put the npy files in data/label_images. Then you can call doodler like this in a loop:

```
for file in data/label_images/*.npy
do python doodler.py -c config.json -f $file
done
```

and it will cycle through each of the npy annotations, make a new label and probability image based on the current version of the CRF inference encoded in the main program.

The above code is a bash command, so on Windows you'd need [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), or have m2-base installed (`conda install m2-base`)
