 Spaces in image file names are problematic for the program because it uses filename string subsections to match images to outputs. White space is the escape character for most programming languages.

 A one-liner for replacing white spaces with underscores in bash is

 `find -name "* *" -type f | rename 's/ /_/g'`

 The above command will replace spaces with underscores. Make a copy of your images beforehand for extra caution. The above code is a bash command, so on Windows you'd need [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), or have m2-base installed (`conda install m2-base`)
