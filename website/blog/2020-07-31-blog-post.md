`Doodler` can use 1, 3, and 4-band input imagery. If the imagery is 3-band, it is assumed to be RGB and is, by default, augmented with 3 additional derivative bands.

But how do you make a 4-band image from a 3-band image and a 1-band image?

That additional 1-band might be that acquired with an additional sensor, but might more commonly be a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) corresponding to the scene.

I know of two ways. If you have `gdal` binaries installed, first strip the image into its component bands using `gdal_translate`
```
gdal_translate -b 1 data/images/4_rgb.png red.png
gdal_translate -b 2 data/images/4_rgb.png green.png
gdal_translate -b 3 data/images/4_rgb.png blue.png
```

Then merge them together using `gdal_merge.py`

```
gdal_merge.py -separate -o merged.tiff -co PHOTOMETRIC=MINISBLACK red.png green.png blue.png data/images/4_elev.png
```

The equivalent in python can be acheived without the `gdal` bindings, using the libraries already in your `doodler` conda environment

First, import libraries

```
import tifffile
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

Read RGB image

```
im1 = cv2.imread('data/images/4_rgb.png')
```

Read elevation and get just the first band (if this is 3-band)

```
im2 = cv2.imread('data/images/4_elev.png')[:,:,0]
```

If you had a 1-band elevation image, it would be this instead...

```
im2 = cv2.imread('data/images/4_elev.png')
```

Merge bands - creates a numpy array with 4 channels

```
merged = np.dstack((im1, im2))
```

Write the image to file

```
tifffile.imsave('test.tiff', merged)
```

You can use the following to read it back in

```
merged = tifffile.imread('test.tiff')
```

And verify with 'shape' - it should be 4 bands

```
merged.shape
```
